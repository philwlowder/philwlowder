# Phil W. Lowder

I live in Albemarle, NC. I first became interested in computing in the late 1970s.
I recall seeing some early Apple computers at Columbia State Community College in Columbia, TN.
Students such as I were working on terminals attached to a mainframe.

I took a few more classes at Central Carolina Technical College in Sumter, SC.
Students were working on terminals attached to DEC PDP-11. I enjoyed a course in BASIC programming
far more than any of the other courses. Only when I had my own pc in 1988 did computers become less of a mystery.
I was able to understand the file sturcture and MS-DOS.

## Profile Picture

The profile picture is a picture of my father, Robert F. Lowder, below Falls Dam on the Yadkin River. I'm pretty sure my mother took the picture
in the late 1940s.
